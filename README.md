# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
<p>This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Python. The model processes email data from the widely used spam.csv dataset and applies text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to train a robust classifier.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The spam.csv dataset was used for training and testing the model. It contains labeled email data categorized as spam or ham.</p>
